# Execution

Jinx supports alternative backends for executing J sentences.

The following execution backends are available:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): the default Jinx executor, implements many J primitives.
- [JAX](https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/index.html): highly experimental, most functionality not yet implemented or incomplete.
